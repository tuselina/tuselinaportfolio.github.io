          <p>Producing a three-dimensional environment compared to a two dimensional design was different due to the fact I needed to keep in mind about the physics, size and weighting which matters in retrospect to how the functions will work accordingly to other forms.</p>

            It was important to have a working prototype to my design process as the interactions and functionality of the machine was more crucial than the aesthetics. The primary focus was on the complex and interesting interactions of the ball hitting different obstacles onto other pathways. </p>
  
            <p>The role was using an animated camera that moves accordingly to  where it is placed at each frame on the timeline when the game is in play mode.  We would place the camera facing the game on a side angle going in a downwards diagonal direction. For sizing and framing of the game in action I used the rule of thirds for framing every shot. In Assignment 1 the camera uses more medium, wide establishing shots that are mostly static. Whilst the virtual camera is moving and following a subject that is progressing downwards. Only one similarity is that both cameras zoom into the female character and the ball in the frame to pull focus. </p>

              <p>I used sound effects of the ball bouncing similar to a basketball or tennis ball impact on the concrete ground. I used a metal ting for a reaction against the metal cutlery obstacles. For background music I used slow jazz to create a restaurant space, that is calm and peaceful alike to the game playing smoothly. 
              </p>
              <p>I wanted to create a fine dining restaurant style concept. Using a dining table asset package and the interior room sky box to unify all the elements together to design an environment that emulates a restaurant setting. </p>
              <p>I discovered that play testing is unpredictable and not every play test will be the exact same. It is a trial and error process that takes a lot of patience. 
  
                Sound effects in Unity compared to A1 is quite different as it uses non digetic sounds such as voice overs are not visible. However, in A2 and A3 the sound effect elements used are quite similar as they are digetic and are actual sounds that can be seen on the screen, such as the impact and collision of the ball hitting the ground and obstacles. While the icons are animated to move in motion with food, the action visualized matches the sound effect.
