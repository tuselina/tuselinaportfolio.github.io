            I disassembled the audio trying to find voice over words and sentences that would match the video component. Actions that describe the womanâ€™s negative character and describing a situation or a certain setting. After, I would stitch the pieces I found all together by adjusting the sound levels to create a coherent sentence that flows together smoothly. 
            
          </p>
        
          <p>
            I decided what parts I was going to keep by selecting little clip frames where the female main character has a slight change in expression that kind of looks sinister on its own. Whilst also deleting any footages that connotes happiness such as smiling which is not what I was looking for. 
          </p>
        
          <p>
            I have learnt that sound plays a big part on the how the mood and ambience is set. Therefore I focused on finding sinister and suspenseful music to further enunciate the evil grin/smirk and negative attitude whilst also highlighting the harsh working conditions in fields. Sound has a greater impact that can make things feel closer than they appear. Non diegetic sounds such as a heart beating off screen can evoke intense emotion inside the viewer. As the meaning is abstract as if the perfume is alive and breathing.

           A faster paced edit means a short span of time has passed and long duration of clips represents time is passing slowly. 
           <br>
           I rearranged the clips into a timeline that is not in chronological order like the original video, showing the process of making the perfume from flowers picked from the field. Which is over a long period of time. 
I cut the clips back and forth between the two locations of the modern lady going about her day getting ready and doing social activities. In contrast to the factory, outdoor fields and natural environments. The jumping back and forth infers that these different events are both happening at the same time.     

          </p>
        
          <p>
            I wanted to create a juxtaposition between the two different settings in the footage to completely change the whole context. Creating a storyline that diverges away from advertising the perfume in a positive light. Rather than being an informative commercial I wanted to create a flip side situation, focusing on the production of the perfume and the people. Shining light on their perspectives, exposing the truth on their hard labor and hard work. I used long fades to convey how draining and tiresome labor work is.

          <p>
           I was intrigued by the feminine beauty aspect of the perfume footage and thought there was wide range of settings to choose from such as the home, factory, fields, cafe and the city establishment shots which could be used for a montage.
